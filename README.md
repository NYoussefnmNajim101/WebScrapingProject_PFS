# WebScrapingProject_PFS

~ # this project is a PFS project in my fourth year of software engeneering with my collegues ...


# so if you want the project to work follow those easy steps 



#> create a virtual environment for a django project 
#> clone this project inside that virtual environment
#> cd  to this folder
#> python manage.py runserver
